:warning: This repo is not actively maintained by CFL. For now, this project is

This repo is the home of Bots for Kids, an exploratory project overseen by
[Code For Life](https://www.codeforlife.education/). Here we provide a space for
contributors to ideate and innovate on how we can get kids of various ages
interested in mechanical and software engineering.

CFL believes using block-based learning is a fun and approachable way to
introduce complex topics to kids. With this in mind, CFL is currently
envisioning using:

1. [blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly), Google's block-based
programming language, to write custom algorithms for bots.

1. [LEGO SPIKE](https://spike.legoeducation.com/), LEGO's robot-building kit, to
build a variety of bots.

1. [Raspberry Pi Build HAT](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/build-hat/),
Raspberry Pi's computer that's compatible with LEGO's sensors and
motors, to be a bot's programmable brain.

While CFL envisions the above, these are not hard requirements and we're open
to contributors' differing ideas. All that matters is we achieve our goal of
getting kids excited about STEM. Share your ideas and CFL will do everything in
our power to empower your creativity!
